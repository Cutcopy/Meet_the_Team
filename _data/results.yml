    "I knew it was important, I knew I had to be relevant. I’m not one to go on about myself, on Facebook, about how great of a real estate agent I am. When everything's said and done, people work with people they like and who are like-minded people. They know I’m a real estate agent, I don’t need to tell them."

    "There are more benefits than just the video. Can I stand in front of a camera, shoot a video, and send it out? Yes, I can. There’s more benefit to that. I love the newsletters, I feel confident, there’s also the validity inside my own team leader industry."

    “I have had probably five different calls for inquiries in that time, which I’m sure will grow as I grow my database and spread out. $550 a month for what you do is a great price. Bang for the buck is really strong. This is one piece of marketing that I feel is very strong and very complimentary. I’ve done the marketing stuff with Facebook and Linkedin, but you’ve got to do video. That’s where it’s at now. It’s the future.”

    "Vyral is a great vehicle to get face-to-face - or at least, people feel like it’s face-to-face with those surveys I take - more so than if you just send them an email with some information or send some recipes. The great thing about it is that it only takes me five minutes to do a video, and it makes one heck of an impression out there. I love the vehicle of it. I was looking for something where I didn’t have to go in, create my own platform, and when I found Vyral Marketing, it was nothing short of a prayer answered for me."

    "I guess I was more or less running my own watered-down version of what it is you guys do for my team now in 6 different markets and 5 different states. With Vyral....the engagement we're having and the conversations are so much more powerful. I'm fairly confident I'll be able to tell you that the 4 deals a month from our database turned into 8 or 12. What I love most is that you guys are always reaching out to me. It's not just about quality of service, but about a message I should consider or a way to tweak my video. I love that!"

    "What I didn't realize is that what Vyral allows me to do is communicate with our past clients, our sphere of influence, people in our database. It's just great database marketing and there's something about being able to eloquently explain or even make it fun. Our videos are goofy. I don't want someone watching a video get bored. I want to be educational and catch their attention. I want to engage with whatever we're sending them."

    "I was burning out energy wise and I liked that Vyral was a) going to get in touch with my database in a professional way regularly and b) it was something to build. The first year, I did well and made money with Vyral...I had a lot of ego-based videos. When I went into the second year and became more educational, it was a different type of video and it was more interesting. As a result, the database themselves started responding better. At this point, the return is huge. I want to say we're talking like a 25X ROI."

    "We've loved the program from day one. We've had very good success. We just really needed to implement video to step up our game. We had one client who's literally watched every single video. That one deal - it'll be $600,000. [Another] customer contacted me two weeks ago...to find a townhouse. He's looking for up to $300,000 so combined we're looking at almost $1M in closed sales from just sending out a few "

  article: >
    "I was making videos on my own before I hired you guys, but I found I was not being consistent with it and I wasn’t getting it out the right way. You guys took it off my plate and I have been consistent. I’m always writing down ideas of what I want to do. I’ll make note of questions clients ask me and I’m constantly trying to think of new things. We did 70 transactions in 2014. In 2015, we did 149 transactions. We doubled our business and a lot of it has to do with the fact that we are providing consistent follow-up to our database."

    "I think I have got five transactions either pending or closed that have come directly from these videos. I just closed one last week and the commission was about 1.5x what I pay for the entire year for Vyral. I didn't know signing up how many things outside of video producing Vyral does.....I have been much more aware of all the other opportunities out there and what other agents are doing.....you are by far looking to meet and exceed expectations......I have already referred three or four agents your way."
